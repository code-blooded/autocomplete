# autocomplete
Autocomplete feature using react.js

The 'basic' implementation implements a linear search over the data to suggest values, the code is pretty simple to follow 
and could be used if the size of your dictionary is not huge.

The 'optimised' implementation implements a trie for faster result fetch and is recommended when the size of your dictionary is huge.

There is also a file 'generate.js' which helps in creating artificial data for testing.
